# such as the names of days and months in both full and abbreviated forms
# for name in calendar.month_name:

#     print(day)

# Calculate days based on a rule: For example, consider
# a team meeting on the first Friday of every month.
# To figure out what days that would be for each month,
# we can use this script:
print("Team meeting will be on :")
